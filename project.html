									<h2>Projects</h2>
									<p>I worked on this project to improve my skills on web development and extend my programming knowlwdge.  </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/code_1.jpg" alt="" /><a id="website"></a></div>
								<p> During the last year, I'm doing my MSc in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles, aka AUVs, 
									and I have dive into programming since the project is a combination of Machine Learning 
									(ML) and Computer Vision (CV). Despite how frustrating is sometimes, actually a lot lot 
									of times, to try to understand the concepts behind ML and CV, I felled in love with programming, 
									and with Python more specifically. I like how dynamically the language is, and how easily and 
									fast allows for building and develop prototypes and models. </p>
								<p>The tinkering, and learning the language all this time drove me to do something that I have never 
									done before, to build my own website. So, I started with the basics, and since I'm a Master Student, 
									the first steps involved a lot of research. I decided to do the website in Python, but how exactly? 
									I found that there are a few web frameworks that Python can use, such as Flask and Django. I don't know, 
									but I chose Django because I liked the name. </p>
								<p>The next step was to dive into Django's documentation and see how can I deploy the portfolio website without 
									being a nightmare. It was unexpected straightforward, from how to start a Django project and app or apps 
									depending on the project, of course, to connect the HTML pages of the project. I learned how to use Bootstrap 
									to style the site (quite a funny process but with tones of customisation, and use of CSS).</p>
								<p>Finally, after almost a week of developing the site, the big moment to go alive came. I found in one article about 
									Heroku, and I was ready to deploy the project there, but accidentally I also found that GitHub allows web hosting 
									through GitHub pages, and it's free. So, after a bit of thought, I conclude to use GitHub as this was my first web 
									site and need to see how can I dot it better and more dynamic to fulfil my needs and since I'm still learning Github 
									was the best, and free, option. </p>

									<h2>Cat-vs-Dog <br />
										image classifier</h2>
									<p>I worked on this project to understand the principles of machine learning and to put them into practice. </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/cnn.png" alt="" /><a id="cat-dog"></a></div>
								<p>My first hands-on project on deep learning was the cats and dogs image classification using Kaggle's dataset.   
									The concept of the project is to create an autonomous vehicle capable not only to detect underwater objects 
									(mainly the underwater infrastructure) but also to be able to examine in depth the integrity of such structures. 
									Hence to give the appropriate solutions and take actions to mitigate any given detected faults. 
									Such a project requires to master and understand in-depth mathematical and statistical concepts. </p>
								<p>Fortunately, I had to spend only a small amount of my time remembering linear algebra and statistics since 
									I had been taught all these in my previous academic years. So, I focused on the most basic concepts of machine learning, 
									such as clustering, support vector machines, linear and logistic regression etc. But, all these were to abstract and 
									general to me, so I started to look at what could possibly do to learn all these concepts by doing instead of just reading. </p>
								<p>At the same time, I joined the university's machine learning course offered by the CS school, and the first assignment was to use Kaggle's Titanic dataset 
									to predict which passengers would survive. Upon completing the assignment, I was so fascinated to continue with machine learning, and I decided to start 
									another project more relevant to my area, and thus I started the cats-and-dogs image classification. 
									During my journey to image classification, I learned a fair amount of the TensorFlow and Keras frameworks, how to preprocess the data, and how to split 
									them into training, validation and test datasets.</p>
								<p>Also,  I learn to use deferent techniques (such as data augmentation and feature extraction using pre-trained models) on the data in order to get better and more accurate results. 
									I even wrote scripts which performs bulk rename on the photos and splits the data into training, validation and test datasets. 
									Finally, I experiment a lot using virtual environments for the project and work the image classification on both pure python scripts as well as using jupyter notebooks. </p>

									<h1>Performance Analysis of Feature Extraction Methods<a id="cfd"></a><br />
										towards Underwater vSLAM </h1>
									<p>I worked on this project as part pf my MSc thesis </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/cfd.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>
									In recent years, the rapid development of Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) technology has provided improvements for robot localization. However, for autonomous underwater vehicles, feature extraction methods in underwater environments have not been studied much due to the specificity of their application scenarios. For this purpose, this paper evaluates and analyzes the performance of feature detecting and matching in underwater environments by using well-known interest points detectors and descriptors in vSLAM. The performance of different well-known interest points detectors and descriptors is compared and analyzed by simulation experiments using four sets of underwater image data and combining histogram equalization-based and deep learning-based image enhancement algorithms. The experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the image enhancement algorithm and feature extraction methods in underwater environments, and the quantitative comparison concludes that ORB algorithm has an advantage in underwater environments.
