### <font color="#0000dd">Brief bio</font>

I am a Control Engineering Master's student under the supervision of [Prof. Di Wu](http://homepage.hrbeu.edu.cn/web/wudi1) at Harbin Engineering University. My research focus is on lifelong SLAM in dynamic environments. I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Information and Computing Sciences at Shandong University of Science and Technology.

Previously, my research has centred around navigation and mapping problems for autonomous robots operating in underwater environments. I used to be an intern at [Goertek](https://www.goertek.com/en/),  where I researched SLAM algorithms in VR/AR. Currently, I am a visiting student at Southern University of Science and Technology under the supervision of [Prof. Zhiyun Lin](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/linzy/).

My passion for continuously learning new and exciting things is rooted in engineering and technology.
