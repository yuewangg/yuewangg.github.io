									<h2>Personal Portfolio website </h2>
									<p>I worked on this project to improve my skills on web development and extend my programming knowlwdge. <br/>I used Python
										and Django for my site. </p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/code_1.jpg" alt="" /><a id="website"></a></div>
								<p> During the last year, I'm doing my PhD in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles, aka AUVs, 
									and I have dive into programming since the project is a combination of Machine Learning 
									(ML) and Computer Vision (CV). Despite how frustrating is sometimes, actually a lot lot 
									of times, to try to understand the concepts behind ML and CV, I felled in love with programming, 
									and with Python more specifically. I like how dynamically the language is, and how easily and 
									fast allows for building and develop prototypes and models. </p>
								<p>The tinkering, and learning the language all this time drove me to do something that I have never 
									done before, to build my own website. So, I started with the basics, and since I'm a Master Student, 
									the first steps involved a lot of research. I decided to do the website in Python, but how exactly? 
									I found that there are a few web frameworks that Python can use, such as Flask and Django. I don't know, 
									but I chose Django because I liked the name. </p>
								<p>The next step was to dive into Django's documentation and see how can I deploy the portfolio website without 
									being a nightmare. It was unexpected straightforward, from how to start a Django project and app or apps 
									depending on the project, of course, to connect the HTML pages of the project. I learned how to use Bootstrap 
									to style the site (quite a funny process but with tones of customisation, and use of CSS).</p>
								<p>Finally, after almost a week of developing the site, the big moment to go alive came. I found in one article about 
									Heroku, and I was ready to deploy the project there, but accidentally I also found that GitHub allows web hosting 
									through GitHub pages, and it's free. So, after a bit of thought, I conclude to use GitHub as this was my first web 
									site and need to see how can I dot it better and more dynamic to fulfil my needs and since I'm still learning Github 
									was the best, and free, option. </p>

									<h2>Cat-vs-Dog <br />
										image classifier</h2>
									<p>I worked on this project to improve my skills on web development and extend my programming knowlwdge. <br/>I used Python
										and Django for my site. </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/cnn.png" alt="" /><a id="cat-dog"></a></div>
								<p>My first hands-on project on deep learning was the cats and dogs image classification using Kaggle's dataset. 
									Everything started almost a year ago when I started my PhD in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles at Newcastle University.  
									The concept of the project is to create an autonomous vehicle capable not only to detect underwater objects 
									(mainly the underwater infrastructure) but also to be able to examine in depth the integrity of such structures. 
									Hence to give the appropriate solutions and take actions to mitigate any given detected faults. 
									Such a project requires to master and understand in-depth mathematical and statistical concepts. </p>
								<p>Fortunately, I had to spend only a small amount of my time remembering linear algebra and statistics since 
									I had been taught all these in my previous academic years. So, I focused on the most basic concepts of machine learning, 
									such as clustering, support vector machines, linear and logistic regression etc. But, all these were to abstract and 
									general to me, so I started to look at what could possibly do to learn all these concepts by doing instead of just reading. </p>
								<p>At the same time, I joined the university's machine learning course offered by the CS school, and the first assignment was to use Kaggle's Titanic dataset 
									to predict which passengers would survive. Upon completing the assignment, I was so fascinated to continue with machine learning, and I decided to start 
									another project more relevant to my area, and thus I started the cats-and-dogs image classification. 
									During my journey to image classification, I learned a fair amount of the TensorFlow and Keras frameworks, how to preprocess the data, and how to split 
									them into training, validation and test datasets.</p>
								<p>Also,  I learn to use deferent techniques (such as data augmentation and feature extraction using pre-trained models) on the data in order to get better and more accurate results. 
									I even wrote scripts which performs bulk rename on the photos and splits the data into training, validation and test datasets. 
									Finally, I experiment a lot using virtual environments for the project and work the image classification on both pure python scripts as well as using jupyter notebooks. </p>

									<h1>Ship Hull Optimization<a id="cfd"></a><br />
										by using Bulbous Stern </h1>
									<p>I worked on this project as part pf my MSc thesis </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/cfd.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The present study addresses the effectiveness of a bulbous stern in a container ship by estimating the resistance using semi-empirical and numerical methods (CFD).  The estimation of the resistance is a critical aspect of a ship which affects the power needed to propel the ship, hence the fuel consumption and the gas emissions to the environment. Container vessels are in continuous operation moving commodities of one place of the earth to the other. Therefore, it is vital to be able to operate with the least possible resistance in order to minimise fuel consumption and their carbon footprint. 
								</p>
								<p>For this reason, the hull should be as efficient as possible and can be achieved by applying different techniques to improve the resistance, one of which is the bulbous stern technic. A stern bulb has its basis on the effects of the bulbous bow, which creates an additional wave that that counteracts the wave that is created by the bow with a result a reduced drag. Similarly, a stern bulb attached on the ship’s transom redistributes the wave pattern at the transom area which leads to minimising the wave-making resistance.</p>
								<p>
									In this thesis, the concept of the Stern Bulb has been proposed for reducing the wave-making resistance. The particular area has not been extensively studied, and there are not extensive data to evaluate its effectiveness, especially using CFD simulations in a personal computer which by itself is a challenging task, thus different methods needed to be used such as the Holtrop’s method and Michell’s thin ship theory to validate the CFD results. The chosen container vessel was modelled in dedicated Naval Architecture software using parametric transformation, and a parent hull was obtained, which was the basis of the resistance estimation using bothe the semi-empirical methods and CFD. The next step involved the design of different models of bulbs in CAD software and the preparation of the geometry of the ship models for importing into CFD software for meshing and simulation.  

								</p>
								<p>
									All models, the parent hull, together with the hulls with the different bulb shapes, were tested initially by the semi-empirical methods of resistance estimation, using Holtrop’s method as well as the estimation of the resistance using the analytical method based on Michell’s thin ship theory. From the results observed that Holtrop’s method is more an ideal estimation of the resistance and used to verify the CFD results because Holtrop’s method is incapable of modelling the stern bulb. On the other hand, Michell’s thin ship theory takes into account the wave resistance, which captures the behaviour of the bulbous stern more realistically. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The same hulls were tested in CFD based on the same conditions (speed, draft, water density and temperature, sea condition) as those in the semi-empirical, and the analytical methods, using a multi-fluid domain with a free surface. Following, from the CFD simulations results, the hull with the best performance was chosen, and a full resistance curve was obtained, and compared with the semi-empirical results, and found that both tests giving similar outcome, which validates that the CFD simulations. Furthermore, the models were simulated in CFD in a mono-fluid domain in order to be able to compute the wave resistance to find the actual outcome of the resistance. These results were compared with the thin ship theory results and resistance curve found to have approximately similar behaviour. Finally,  a script which computes the wave resistance based in Michell’s used to evaluate the CFD wave resistance results. Both methods gave similar results up to a particular, where beyond that speed, Michell’s theory gave higher outcomes, which is because it overestimates the resistance at higher Froude numbers.
