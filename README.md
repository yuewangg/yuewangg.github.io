### <font color="#0000dd">Brief bio</font>

I am a Master Student at Harbin Engineering University, before that I completed my bachelor's degree at Shandong University of Science and Technology. 
My previous research is centered around the problems of navigation and mapping for autonomous robots operating in underwater environments. Now, I am an intern at [Goertek](https://www.goertek.com/), and mainly working on VR/AR and SLAM. The focus of my research is lifelong SLAM in dynamic environments.

I am passionate about continually learning new and exciting things, and particularly things related to engineering and technology.
