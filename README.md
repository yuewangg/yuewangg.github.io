### <font color="#0000dd">Brief bio</font>

I am a control engineering Master student, at Harbin Engineering University. The focus of my research is lifelong SLAM in dynamic environments. Prior to that, I completed my bachelor's degree at Shandong University of Science and Technology. I have two bachelor's degrees, Electrical Engineering & Information and Computing Sciences.

My previous research is centered around the problems of navigation and mapping for autonomous robots operating in underwater environments. I was an intern worked on SLAM algorithms in VR/AR at [Goertek](https://www.goertek.com/en/). Right now, Right now, I am a visiting student at Southern University of Science and Technology under the supervision of [Prof. Zhiyun Lin](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/linzy/).

I am passionate about continually learning new and exciting things, and particularly things related to engineering and technology.
