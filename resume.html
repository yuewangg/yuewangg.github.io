													<h3>PhD Research Student</h3>
													<h4>Newcastle University - Newcastle upon Tyne</h4>
													<p class="subDetails">October 2019 - Present</p>
													<p>During the first year of PhD, I expanded my programming knowledge using Python. Also, I dived into Machine Learning and Computer Vision fields which I found exciting to study and really fun by doing simple projects such as creating a Dog vs Cat classifier and predicting the survivals on the Titanic disaster on Kaggle. Furthermore, the year's reward was the 3rd place that I was awarded with in PG annual Conference at Newcastle University.</p>
