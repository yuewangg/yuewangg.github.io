### <font color="#0000dd">Brief bio</font>

I am a Master Student at Harbin Engineering University, before that I completed my bachelor's degree at Shandong University of Science and Technology. 
My previous research is focused on developing an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) using Computer Vision and Machine Learning which would be capable of underwater intervention.Now, I am doing an internship at [Goertek](https://www.goertek.com/). Mainly working on VR/AR and SLAM. 
I am passionate about continually learning new and exciting things, and particularly things related to engineering and technology.
